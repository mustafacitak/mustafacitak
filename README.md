Mustafa Çıtak is an AI R&D Engineer specializing in reasoning-centric large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, evaluation benchmarks (G-EVAL, Humanity's Last Exam), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex. He has hands-on mastery of the full AI workflow—including RLHF, DPO, PEFT (LoRA, QLoRA), and scalable distributed training on platforms such as Axolotl, DeepSpeed, and Ray.

His technical toolkit covers Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAPI, and React, along with Gradio, Streamlit, and advanced deployment solutions (Docker, Kubernetes, vLLM). Mustafa excels in vector databases (Typesense, Meilisearch), data engineering, model evaluation (LM Evaluation Harness, Agent Arena, SnakeBench), and multimodal AI (audio, vision, and cross-modal models).

Active in the AI community, Mustafa co-hosts the "Bir Şeylerin Teorisi" podcast with Fatih Candan and has built a LinkedIn following of 20,000+. An avid motocross enthusiast, he brings a passion for high performance to both his engineering and personal pursuits.
